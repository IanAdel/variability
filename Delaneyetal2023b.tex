\item Water discharge variations in subglacial channels are mainly accommodated by water velocity, not channel size.
\item Greater variability in water velocity causes sediment transport capacity to vary more in subglacial channels than in subaerial channels.

\begin{abstract}  Sediment transport capacity in subglacial and subaerial channels depends on  water velocity and channel width, which together control the shear stress exerted on the channel bottom.
  In subaerial channels, width, and velocity evolve quickly with water discharge, while in subglacial channels, water discharge changes mainly affect water velocity due to slow-evolving channel geometry.
  Parameterizations of these subglacial and subaerial hydraulics are applied to hydrographs from an Alpine glacier and the Greenland Ice Sheet revealing greater variability in sediment transport capacity in subglacial channels.
  Furthermore, results show that high subglacial sediment transport rates can persist across various water discharges.
  Slowly evolving channel width accommodates some variability in subglacial channels.
  Despite differences in response to water discharge, sediment discharge measurements generally correlate better with subaerial hydraulic parameters.
  This implies that other factors like sediment access or proglacial processes might be at play, affecting sediment transport capacity differently in subglacial and subaerial channels.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

Changes in glacier dynamics, geomorphology, and hydrology  have prompted numerous  recent studies of  sediment transport processes in cold regions \cite<e.g.>{zhang2022}.
Increases in sediment transport  have been observed in Greenland \cite{bendixen2017}, the European Alps \cite{costa2017}, the Himalayas \cite{li2021}, and the Andes \cite{vergara2022}.
In some regions, increased water discharge and glacier melt have been interpreted to yield greater sediment transport capacity \cite{bendixen2017,costa2017,li2021}.
Observed changes to sediment transport in glacierized catchments require examining the processes controlling sediment discharge in these catchments and its variations with water discharge  \cite<e.g.>{riihimaki2005,swift2005}.

Over long periods, processes such as glacier abrasion and quarrying sculpt landscapes and create sediment to be transported fluvially from under glaciers \cite<c.f.>{hallet1979,iverson2012,ugelvig2018}.
On shorter time periods, pressurized water transports sediment from underneath glaciers \cite{walder1994,creyts2013,beaud2018,delaney2019}, should enough sediment be present subglacially (i.e. in a transport-limited regime).

In a transport-limited regime, sediment discharge responds to the sediment transport capacity, defined as the amount of sediment the water can carry.
Sediment transport capacity depends on the shear stress between water and the sediment it flows  over \cite{shields1936,meyer1948,engelund1967} along with the width of the channel bottom $w_c$ over which to mobilize sediment.
The shear stress  across the channel width $\tau_t$ responds to the velocity of water $v$ flowing through the channel so that
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tau_t}
    \tau_t \propto w_c\, v^2,
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
%
where $w_c$ is the width of the channel. Following mass conservation, the velocity of the water flowing through a  channel is
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:v}
    v = \frac{Q}{S},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $Q$ is water discharge,  and $S$ is the channel's wetted area.

In subaerial channels, operating with open channel flow, the wetted area $S$ of the channel evolves with changing water discharge $Q$, by changing both the channel's width and the water depth \cite{leopold1953}.
The change in water depth results in a commensurate increase in water velocity.
Thus,  fulfilling Equation~\ref {eq:v}, the higher discharge is accommodated by both an increase in wetted area and flow velocity.
As a result, the shear stress across the channel $\tau_t$ increases according to Equation~\ref{eq:tau_t}.

The response of water velocity to changing water discharge in subglacial channels differs from subaerial ones.
The size of subglacial channels responds to the creep closure of the ice above and the opening of the channel by frictional heating of water flowing through the channel \cite{rothlisberger1972}.
As a result, the subglacial channel size only evolves relatively slowly over days to months, whereas water discharge can vary over hours \cite<e.g.>{iken1986,andrews2014,nanni2020}.
Therefore, subglacial water flow behaves more like pipe flow, and changes in water discharge $Q$ are mainly accommodated with increased or decreased water velocity $v$ \cite{alley1997} because the size of the channel $S$ changes on a much longer timescale (Equation~\ref{eq:v} and Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}).
%It follows that an increase in water discharge $Q$ will cause the shear stress across the channel $\tau_t$ to respond with water velocity $v$, as opposed to subaerial channels where channel width $w_c$ evolves as well.

% \ian{Come back to Daniel's comments}

As a result, sediment mobilization in subaerial and subglacial channels responds differently to changing water discharge.
These differences are implicitly included in a wide range of available models that  quantify sediment transport in both subglacial and subaerial channels  \cite<e.g.>{walder1994,alley1997,tucker1997,creyts2013,delaney2019,hewitt2019,wickert2019}.
The divergent response of changing water discharge on sediment mobilization capacity may well impact sediment dynamics at glacier margins where flow transitions from pressurized to open channel flow \cite<e.g.>{perolo2018}.
Additionally, the variable response of sediment transport capacity to water discharge in the two systems may affect the interpretation of sediment transport records in glacial systems \cite<e.g.>{muller1968,richards2003,swift2005,ganti2016}.
Yet, little work has examined the differing relationship between variations in water discharge and sediment discharge in subglacial and subaerial channels \cite{alley1997}.
%Furthermore, thorough observations of water velocity and channel width in subglacial channels are limited and, to these authors' knowledge, not contrasted with subaerial conditions at the glacier margins. %\mauro{self-cite here?}

This manuscript evaluates the relationship between sediment transport capacity and water discharge in subglacial channels and compares it to subaerial ones.
In the absence of continuous measurements of subglacial and subaerial water velocity and channel morphology, numerical parameterizations of subglacial and subaerial hydraulics are utilized.
Parameterizations are applied to hydrological records from an Alpine glacier in Switzerland (Fieschergletscher) and  a land-terminating glacier in Greenland (Leverett Glacier).
The parameterizations' lumped nature isolates the disparity between water discharge and sediment transport capacity in subglacial systems, independent of the upstream drainage network and sediment access.
Outputs demonstrate differences in the relationships between  water discharge, channel geometry, and water velocity in the subglacial and subaerial channels.
Furthermore, outputs are compared to sediment discharge data from these two catchments.
The manuscript then uses the demonstrated differences between the two channel types to discuss the implications for interpreting the processes driving variability in records of sediment transport from glacierized catchments.

\section{Study sites and data}
\label{sect:ss_data}

Water and suspended sediment data are leveraged from Alpine and ice sheet settings.
The Alpine site (\alpine) is  Fieschergletscher in the Swiss Alps ($46^\circ\,29'\,07''$ N, $8^\circ\,08'\,3''$ E).
Water discharge and suspended sediment concentration were collected here at a $1$\unit{min} interval continuously over the period 2014--2021.
See \citeA{felix2022} and \citeA{felix2021} for more details.

The Leverett Glacier in Greenland (\icesheet) serves as the ice sheet setting.
Water discharge and suspended sediment concentration data were collected roughly $2$\unit{km} downstream from the terminus between June and August/September 2009 to 2012 ($67^\circ\,03'\,5''$ N, $50^\circ\,12'\,59''$ W).
Data is used from \citeA{tedstone2017} and \citeA{hawkings2014} at a $5$\,\unit{min} time interval from May 28, 2012 to August 8, 2012.
Two gaps (14.07.2012 to 15.07.2012 and 16.07.2012 to 17.07.2021) in suspended sediment data were interpolated using a linear spline.

\section{Methods}
\label{sect:meth}
The parameterizations below (Sections ~\ref{sect:sub_mode}~and~\ref{sect:fluv}) represent relationships amongst water discharge, water velocity, and channel geometry in both subaerial and subglacial channels (Table \ref{table:vpm}).
Both parameterizations calculate   water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress, upon which sediment transport depends \cite<Figure \ref{fig:cartoon}; >{shields1936}.
The evaluation of these variables omits the selection of a sediment transport relationship and a grain-size parameter \cite<e.g.>{shields1936,meyer1948} needed to calculate sediment transport capacity from shear stress.


\subsection{Subglacial channel  parameterization}
\label{sect:sub_mode}

To evaluate the shear stress of water flowing across sediments underneath a glacier, the subglacial channel parameterization takes into account the channel geometry and the velocity of the flowing water.
To do this, a modified version of the lumped hydraulics model presented in \citeA{clarke1996} and \citeA{werder2010} is used.

Here, it is assumed that the water is transported through a subglacial channel \cite<Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}; >{rothlisberger1972}, and that the channel  size responds to frictional heating from water flow and creep closure by ice, using the Darcy-Weisbach formulation for water-flow through a pipe  \cite<e.g.>{rothlisberger1972,clarke2003}.
The formulation here does not consider the englacial storage of water.
Thus, it is assumed that the changing hydraulic head at the top of the glacier is negligible in the channel size evolution.
The evolution of subglacial channel size $S_g$ is given as
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dS_dt}
    \frac{\partial S_g}{\partial t} = C_1 \frac{Q \Delta h}{l} - C_2 \left(h_{o}-\frac{\Delta h}{2}\right)^n\,S_g,
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\noindent where $C_1= (1-\rho_wc_pc_t)\,\frac{\rho_wg}{\rho_iL}$ and $C_2=2A(\frac{\rho_wg}{n})^n$ are constants (Table \ref{table:vpm}), $l$ is the length of the subglacial channel, $Q$ is water discharge, $\Delta h$ is the hydraulic potential change from the glacier terminus to its top, $h_{o}= \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_w} h_{ice}$ is the ice overburden pressure, and $n$ is Glen's n \cite{glen1955} (usually $n=3$).
The first term on the right side of the equation represents the opening of the channel through frictional heating, while the following term represents the creep closure of the channel from ice deformation.


Following the Darcy-Weisbach equation, head drop $\Delta h$ is,
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dh}
    \Delta h \,  = l \,\frac{1}{g}\,s\,f_r\,\frac{Q^2}{D_h^5}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
\noindent where $f_r$ is a friction factor, $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter, and $l$ is the length over which head change occurs. $s$ is a factor accounting for channel geometry \cite{hooke1990}, calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Hf}
  s = \frac{2\,(\beta -\sin \beta)^2}{(\frac{\beta}{2}\,+\,\sin \frac{\beta}{2})^4},
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is the central angle of the circular segment that comprises the channel (the so-called Hooke angle). Note that $\beta =\pi$ corresponds to a semi-circle and
smaller values of $\beta$ result in shallow, wide channels.
The hydraulic diameter $D_h$ is converted to wetted area $S_g$ given a channel geometry following \cite{hooke1990}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Dh2S}
  S_g= \frac{D_h^2}{2}\,\frac{(\frac{\beta}{2}+\sin \frac{\beta}{2})^2}{\beta - \sin \beta}.
\end{equation}

With wetted area $S_g$, the shear stress, $\tau_g$, between the water and the channel bed is determined through the Darcy-Weisbach formulation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tau}
  \tau_g=\frac{1}{8}\,f_r\,\rho_w\,v_g^2,
\end{equation}
%
where $v_g = \frac{Q}{S_g}$ is the water velocity.

The width-integrated shear stress is represented as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tautg}
  \tau_{tg}=w_{cg}\,\tau_g,
\end{equation}

where  channel floor width $w_{cg}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dh2wc}
  w_{cg} = 2  \sin \frac{\beta}{2} \sqrt{\frac{2\, S_g}{\beta -\sin \beta}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Subaerial channel  parameterization}
\label{sect:fluv}

To parameterize the shear stress of water flowing across sediments in the subaerial channel, the hydraulics parameterization presented in \citeA{tucker1997} is implemented.
Using mass conservation and the Darcy-Weisbach relationship as well as assuming that the channel is wide so that the hydraulic radius is well approximated by the flow depth, then
the shear stress $\tau_f$ at the river bed is
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:DW_tau}
    \tau_f=\frac{\rho_w\,g^{\frac{2}{3}}\,f_p^{\frac{1}{3}}}{2}\, \Big(\frac{Q}{w_{cf}} \Big)^{\frac{2}{3}} \,\nabla z_c^{\frac{2}{3}},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\nabla z_c$ is the channel slope, and $f_p$ is the friction factor for subaerial channels.
Channel width $w_{cf}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wcf}
  w_{cf} = k \, Q^{\alpha},
\end{equation}
%
where $k$ is a constant and $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$ is a commonly chosen exponent \cite{leopold1953}.
Water velocity, $v_f$, is given by rearranging Equation \ref{eq:tau} as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vf}
  v_f = \sqrt{\frac{8\,\tau_f}{f_p\,\rho_w}}.
\end{equation}
%
As above, the width-integrated shear stress is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tautf}
    \tau_{tf}=w_{cf}\,\tau_f.
  \end{equation}

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sect:imp}

The parameterizations above are applied to hydrological records from the Fieschergletscher (\alpine) and the Leverett Glacier (\icesheet).
The subglacial and subaerial parameterizations represent the subglacial flow of water exiting a glacier and transitioning to subaerial flow.
Outputs of the parameterizations represent generalizable sediment transport characteristics from these hydrographs, rather than actual hydraulic conditions.
To generalize these cases, \alpine{}  is exemplified by relatively thin ice thickness ($h_{ice}$: $225$\,\unit{m}), low water discharge ($\sim\,10$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$) and high diurnal variability in water discharge (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}, a).
\icesheet{}  is exemplified by thick ice  ($h_{ice}$: $700$\,\unit{m}), high water discharge ($\sim\,300$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$)  and low diurnal variability in water discharge (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}, e).

For each glacier, the parameterizations are first applied to a reference test case for each glacier that assumes  a subglacial channel with $\beta=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
Friction factors $f_r$ and $f_p$ are tuned so that the parameterizations reproduce reasonable water velocities for both \alpine and \icesheet{}\cite<$\sim\,1.6\,$\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$>{werder2010b,chandler2013}.
In both subaerial channels, the bed slope is $\nabla z_c = 0.05$.
% Water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress in the subglacial and subaerial channels from this formulation are presented below.

Second, to further characterize the variability in sediment discharge capacity in subglacial compared to subaerial channels, $100$  parameterizations are applied to a range of different channel geometry factors ($\beta$ and $k$) and friction factors ($f_r$ and $f_p$).
Runs with parameter combinations are culled if their mean subglacial water velocity over the season lies between $0.75$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ and $2$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ or if subaerial water velocity lies between $0.3$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ and $1.2$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$, in accordance with measurements \cite<e.g.>{werder2010b,magnusson2012,chandler2013}.
The variability of output is represented by the  standard deviation of that output over the course of the season. 

Lastly, outputs are compared with the sediment discharge records of the glaciers using Spearman rank correlation, dependent on the ordering of values.
Rank correlation reduces the impact of the non-linear response of sediment transport capacity to the hydrological forcing.
Outputs and observations at $15$\,\unit{min} intervals are aggregated across timescales of up to $15$\,\unit{days} by averaging values one-half of the timescale before and after a point time.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Role of water discharge in sediment transport capacity}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Fig2.pdf}
  \caption{Parameterization outputs from the hydrographs n panels a and e for \alpine cases (a-d) and \icesheet{} (e-h).

  }
  \label{fig:model_outs}
\end{figure}

Following the parameterizations defined in Sections~\ref{sect:sub_mode}~and~\ref{sect:fluv}, the water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress exhibit different seasonal evolutions and peaks.
Water velocity and shear stress represent the potential for sediment mobilization, and width-integrated shear stress represents a proxy for the total sediment transport capacity across the channel bed (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}).

In the subglacial channel, peaks generally occur when water discharge increases at the fastest rate (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}).
Alternatively, in the subaerial channel,  sediment transport variables peak  hen water discharge is highest.
The timing of the greatest rate of change in water discharge occurs before the peaks in water discharge.
Furthermore, the subglacial outputs are generally larger than the subaerial values, thus more efficient at transporting sediment.
Here, sediment could be deposited in the proglacial area as the water depressurizes, then remobilized when sediment transport capacity peaks in the subaerial system.

\begin{figure}[h]

    Variables have been normalized to mean values.

    Plots are shown with data and outputs at $15$\unit{min} intervals.
  }
  \label{fig:Qw_vari}
\end{figure}

Each water discharge value in the subaerial channel results in a unique water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress, creating a perfect rank correlation between the variables (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari} a--f).

In the subglacial channel, however, the persistence of high water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress across a range of discharges suggests that substantial sediment transport may occur across  (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari} a--f).



For instance, very high  water velocity values and shear stresses can occur across minimal water discharge at $2.5$\,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ to the maximum water discharge at over $17$ \,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$.
In \icesheet, mean values of water velocity can occur at water discharges between roughly $150$ \,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ and $310$ \,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$.
When considering the subglacial channel's evolving width, width-integrated shear stress  across the channel generally increases with water discharge, with improved rank correlation compared to water velocity or shear stress (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari} a--f).
Yet even the width-integrated shear stress  can vary substantially, with the highest values occurring at water discharge values ranging from roughly $11$ \,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$ to over $17$ \,\unit{m}$^3$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$.
The variability in width-integrated shear stress is less pronounced in the \icesheet case, with reduced variability in water discharge (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari} c, f).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Fig4.png}
    \caption{Variability (standard deviation) of output variables for different time aggregations across the range of subglacial and subaerial channel shapes and friction factors.

    }
    \label{fig:multi_run}
  \end{figure}

Across the range of channel shape parameters and friction factors  examined, variability in water velocity and shear stress remains higher in the subglacial system compared to the subaerial one.
In \alpine{}, the variability in width-integrated shear stress is comparable between the two systems, due to the variable water discharge (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}).
However, in \icesheet{}, with lower water discharge fluctuations, the variability in width-integrated shear stress remains higher in the subglacial system across the time aggregation periods.

It is prescient to evaluate the time scales over which the subglacial channels may respond to changing water discharge to understand the influence of variability in sediment transport capacity.
In both cases, the variability in velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress decreases after $1-5$ day aggregations (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}).
Yet, substantial differences in variability persist in periods of up to $15$ days.
Aggregations periods longer than this might be conflated with seasonal variations in water discharge.
Note that lags and time of peak sediment transport conditions still occur over these periods (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}), while the variability in sediment transport parameters decreases with larger time aggregation (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}).


\subsection{Relationship between parameterization  outputs and observed sediment discharge}

When comparing the outputs with suspended sediment discharge measurements, the subaerial parameterizations generally correlate better with sediment discharge compared to subglacial outputs across the tested parameters (Figures~\ref{fig:Qw_vari} g--l and \ref{fig:multi_run}).
The rank correlation amongst the subaerial parameterization's outputs remains fairly constant despite the variable impact of channel shape and consistent scaling with water discharge (Figure \ref{fig:Qw_vari} and Section~\ref{sect:fluv}).
In subglacial channels, velocity and shear stress perform substantially worse in terms of rank correlation with sediment discharge compared to width-integrated shear stress (Figures~ \ref{fig:multi_run}).
In both \alpine{} and \icesheet{}, the subglacial rank correlation approaches that of subaerial channels over longer time aggregation periods (Figures~ \ref{fig:multi_run} and \ref{fig:model_outs_1hr} to \ref{fig:model_outs_15day}).


\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Sediment capacity differences between the channel types}
\label{sect:dis_qsc}

Quantities that control sediment transport capacity (water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress) vary differently in response to water discharge in subglacial channels compared to subaerial ones (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}).
In sediment transport relationships that evaluate sediment discharge capacity, such as in \citeA{meyer1948} or \citeA{engelund1967}, shear stress is scaled to the power of $\frac{3}{2}$ or $\frac{5}{2}$, respectively.
The exponent greater than $1$ magnifies sediment discharge variability beyond the variable sediment transport parameters described above (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}; Table~\ref{tab:Qs}).
Note that sediment transport relationships describe sediment flux per unit width, so that the integrated capacity across channel occurs after application of the exponent, unlike the width-integrated shear stress evaluation here \cite<Equations\,\ref{eq:tautg} and \ref{eq:tautf}; c.f.>{tucker1997}.
%Note also that both subglacial and subaerial parameterizations here assume that the distribution of velocity and shear stress is homogeneous across the channel bed, despite the limitations of this assumption \cite<e.g.>{yager2018}.

The rapid increases and decreases in subglacial sediment transport capacity compounds the variability in sediment transport already present in subaerial systems \cite<Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}; >{williams1989,jerolmack2010}.
Sediment transport capacity in subglacial channels responds more rapidly to changes in water discharge compared to their subaerial counter parts \cite{alley1997}.
In subglacial R\"othlisberger channels where water discharge evolves more slowly than channel size or subaerial channels the width-integrated shear stress response to water discharge is $ \tau_{tg}\, \propto\,  Q^{\sim\frac{4}{5}}$ (Table\,\ref{tab:eqs1}).
However, subglacial channels rarely operate in a steady state \cite<e.g.>{gimbert2016}.
For sufficiently short time periods, channel width and wetted area are fixed in the subglacial system (assuming pipe flow) so that the response of width-integrated shear stress is $ \tau_{tg}\, \propto\,  Q^{2}$ (Table\,\ref{tab:eqs1}).
\ref{sect:scaling} provides a complete description of sediment transport capacity in different drainage conditions.

The stronger correlation between subglacial hydraulics and water discharge in \icesheet{} could result from the channel being closer to equilibrium between variations in the channels' wetter area and water discharge with smaller diurnal variations in amplitude (Figures~\ref{fig:model_outs} and ~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}).
Conversely, the correlation between hydraulics and water discharge in \alpine is smaller due to the larger discharge variations. 
In both cases, hydraulics could trend toward equilibrium by averaging the discharge over $1-5$ days, when the variability in subglacial channels approaches that of subaerial one (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}).

In subglacial channels, peaks in water velocity, shear stress and width-integrated shear stress occur with  fast rates of water discharge increase relative to the channel's growth (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}).
In turn, subglacial channels grow with increasing water discharge, effectively reduces sediment transport capacity with the stabilization of water discharge at its peak.
Similar feedback occurs in subaerial systems \cite{phillips2016}, albeit at timescales longer than days \cite{gimbert2016}.

\subsection{Records of sediment discharge  from glaciers}

The increased performance of subaerial hydraulics outputs, compared to subglacial ones, in representing observations occurs despite the proximity of measurement locations to these glaciers (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}).
This could occur for two reasons.

First, these measurement stations lie $0.5$ to $2$\,\unit{km} downstream of the glacier terminus \cite{cowton2012,felix2022}, a long enough distance for the pressurized subglacial regime to transition to the open channel subaerial one.
The transition of subglacial to subaerial conditions may occur underneath glacier terminus \cite{perolo2018}, especially if closure rates of the subglacial channels are slow  \cite{rothlisberger1972}.
Furthermore, if a transport-limited regime persists at the glacier margin, then sediment can be easily mobilized, and subaerial processes could be represented just a short distance downstream.

The consistent relationship between sediment discharge capacity and open channel flow conditions could be pronounced $\sim20$\,\unit{km} downstream of the Leverett site, where a strong correlation persists between sediment plume size and the river's water discharge into the Kangerlussuaq fjord \cite{mcgrath2010}.
In contrast, in marine-terminating glacier catchments a less consistent relationship may occur between water discharge or melt extent and sediment plume size \cite{tedstone2012}.
Here, ocean water pressurizes subglacial channels at the ice front \cite<e.g.>{how2017}, so the minimal correlation could result from the inconsistent relationship between subglacial sediment transport capacity and water discharge (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}).

Second, the sediment discharge records could represent processes such as increased sediment accessibility when melt extends up the glacier, thereby increasing sediment and water discharge \cite<e.g.>{vergara2022}.
A supply-limited regime could well persist at many glaciers, because the sediment's threshold of motion can be reached more frequently and across a range of water discharges, compared to subaerial systems (Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}).
Sediment exhaustion occurring through increased variability may also explain the stronger dependence of sediment discharge from the Greenland Ice Sheet on basal shear stress, a proxy for bedrock erosion, rather than glacier melt \cite{overeem2017}.
Note, however, the absence of lags between the observed sediment and water discharge may suggest that sediment is mobilized close to the measurement stations, as opposed to distal areas of the glacier bed as would be expected in a supply-limited regime \cite<Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}\, a and e; >{williams1989}.

Regardless of the increased performance of water discharge compared to subglacial sediment transport capacity in the observations, outputs suggest that additional processes and erosional hiatuses may further complicate signals of sediment discharge from glaciers in response to climate \cite{jansson2005,ganti2016}.
Sediment discharge records have been used to establish the relationship, or lack thereof, between climate forcing and glacial erosion \cite<e.g.>{koppes2009a,ganti2016,willenbring2016,mariotti2021}.
The variable relationship between water discharge and subglacial sediment transport capacity presented here mostly applies to the daily- to weekly-time scales controlling the size of subglacial channels (Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}).
Yet, identifying climatic signals in sediment transport from the transport-limited component of glacier-sedimentary systems may require higher thresholds of water discharge compared to subaerial systems when water discharge varies substantially over short timescales \cite<Figure~\ref{fig:Qw_vari}; >{tofelde2021}.

Over time scales of weeks or longer, the glacier's sediment transport capacity responds to the ice thickness, controlling the channel closure rate, and the glacier's surface slope, in addition to water discharge \cite<Figure~\ref{fig:multi_run}, Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}; >{rothlisberger1972,shreve1972,gimbert2016,stevens2022}.
In a supply-limited state, often assumed in landscape evolution models, then glaciers' sediment discharge record also represents additional processes of sediment availability and bedrock erosion from  water pressure variations and sliding  \cite<e.g.>{iverson2012,herman2015,delaney2023}.
This multitude of processes lies in contrast to most subaerial systems, where transport capacity typically responds to sediment size, water discharge, and hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic gradient generally remains stable over time scales ranging from years to millennia \cite<Section~\ref{sect:fluv}; e.g.>{muller1968,tucker1997,wickert2019}.
The stronger link between sediment transport capacity and hydrological forcing in subaerial channels may mean that variations in sediment transport records can be more easily attributed to climatic conditions than in subglacial systems.

\section{Conclusions}

Sediment transport capacity is largely driven by the shear stress of water flowing through a channel and the channel's width.
Subaerial channels  alter their channel width and water velocity immediately in response to changing water discharge.
In contrast, pressurized subglacial channels largely accommodate changing water discharge by altering water velocity and shear stress, upon which sediment transport depends.
In subglacial channels, water velocity responds quickly to changes in water discharge because their size generally evolves slowly compared to variations in water discharge.
This makes the response of sediment transport capacity much more sensitive to changes in water discharge when compared to subaerial channels.
Despite these differences, parameterizations of subaerial hydraulics in two glacierized catchments generally represent observed sediment discharge variations better than subglacial hydraulics.

Implications of the presented findings include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the inconsistent relationship between water discharge and sediment transport capacity underneath glaciers creates increased variability in sediment transport capacity compared to river systems;
\item the timing of peak sediment transport capacity below glaciers generally coincides with large rates of increasing in water discharge, as opposed to the maximum quantity of water discharge;
\item a consistent relationship between water and sediment discharge may represent subglacial sediment access or open channel hydraulics near the glacier margin, instead of subglacial sediment transport capacity.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Formulas for sediment transport in different drainage regimes}
\label{sect:scaling}

\mauro{Notation: either use $h$ and $w_c$ for the river, or otherwise, somehow free $h$. Below I use $H$ and $W$ for now.}

Here three kinds of drainage regimes are examined, namely, subaerial channels, steady-state R-channels \cite{rothlisberger1972}, and pipe-flow (i.e. R-channels which do not have time to adjust their size to discharge conditions).
Sediment transport capacity is scaled with respect to a given water discharge for three different transport formulas: MPM \cite{meyer1948}, EH \cite{engelund1967}, and Bagnold \cite{bagnold1980}; additionally width-integrated shear stress is assessed, as it is  used as proxy for sediment transport throughout the manuscript.

A few basic hydraulic relations are used in the following.
The Darcy-Weisbach equation can be stated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DW}
  \Psi \propto f\frac{Q^2}{D_h S^2},
\end{equation}
with $\Psi$ the head gradient and friction factor $f$.
The shear stress and stream power are, respectively,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tau-omega}
  \tau \propto f v^2 = f \left(\frac{Q}{S}\right)^2, \quad  \Omega \propto \Psi Q.
\end{equation}
%

Sediment discharge is given by the MPM, EH and Bagnold formulations as, respectively,
\begin{equation}
  Q_s \propto w_c\, \tau^{3/2}, \quad Q_s \propto w_c\, \tau^{5/2}, \quad Q_s \propto w_c \left(\frac{\Omega}{w_c}\right)^{3/2} H^{-2/3}
\end{equation}
for conditions well above the transport onset threshold.

The  subaerial channels is assumed to have a width $w_c$ much greater than its depth $H$, such that $D_h\approx 4h$, and to have a constant head gradient ($\Psi$) given by the topography.
Further, it is  assumed that its width can be approximated by a relation $w_c \propto Q^\alpha$ (Equation~\ref{eq:wcf})with $\alpha\in [0,1]$; typically $\alpha \approx 1/2$ (a so-called regime channel).
End members $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha=1$ correspond a  subaerial channels of constant width (a slot canyon) or depth (no natural equivalent), respectively.
%
For a steady state R-channel, it is assumed that  $\Psi$ is constant (approximated by the gradient of the Shreve \citeyear{shreve1972} potential) and that $S$ adjusts such that it is in steady state with $\Psi$ and $Q$.  %Conversely, pipe flow has $S$ fixed and $\Psi$ adjusts to satisfy the given $Q$.
%
Pipe flow is approximated when a R-channel is subjected to rapid discharge variations such that the channel does not adjust its size significantly on the time scale of the discharge variations.
In this case, it is assumed that the cross-sectional area $S$ is fixed, and $\Psi$ adjusts to the specified $Q$.
For both R-channel and pipe flow, it is assumed assume that $D_h \propto S^{1/2}$.

With these assumptions the Darcy-Weisbach equation~\eqref{eq:DW} can be solved for the not-fixed quantity: $H$ for a  subaerial channel, $S$ for a R-channel, and $\Psi$ for pipe-flow.
Then, using equations~\eqref{eq:tau-omega}, the shear stress and stream power can be calculated.
These results are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:eqs1}.
Now width integrated shear stress and sediment transport can be calculated for all regimes and for all transport formulas.  The results of the 12 combinations are presented in Table~\ref{tab:Qs} and also in Table~\ref{tab:Qs2} where the fractions in the exponents are approximately given by decimal numbers for ease of comparison.

Table~\ref{tab:Qs2} shows that the proxy $w_c\tau$ as well as the MPM, EH and Bagnold sediment transport formulas give roughly a similar scaling of $Q_s$ on hydraulic gradient $\Psi$ or $S$ and on water discharge $Q$.
Remarkably, the Bagnold formula has a negative exponent for $f$ in all but the pipe-flow regime, which seems rather unexpected.
The total transport formula EH gives a slightly stronger dependence on all variables as should be expected due to the larger exponent on $\tau$ of $\frac{5}{2}$ versus  $\frac{3}{2}$  for the others.
Albeit, the sediment transport response in pipe-flow for the Bagnold case is close to EH.
Conversely, the sediment transport proxy $t_{tg},t_{tf}$ used within this publication scales only as $Q^2$ for pipe-flow, whereas the others scale at least with $Q^3$.
The exponent for the width scaling $\alpha$ only impacts relationship between sediment transport and water discharge in the EH relation in any meaningful way.
However, for the value of $\alpha$ around $\frac{1}{2}$,  suits braided proglacial stream and indeed most  subaerial channels.
Furthermore, when $\alpha=1$, the exponent on $Q$ is only slightly above the other values of $\alpha$.

The sediment discharge in the steady state R-channel scales very similarly to the  subaerial channel case for all relations and virtually identically for the $\alpha=0.5$ case.  However, note that the head gradients $\Psi$ are likely higher for comparable $Q$ in a ice-sheet marginal or alpine glacier setting than in a  subaerial channel, as is well described in \citeA{alley1997}, and thus transport rates may still be much higher in a steady state R-channel.

Furthermore, R-channels will rarely operate in steady state as variations in discharge, in particular on the diurnal timescale or the timescale of severe rain or melting events, are too fast for such a channel to reach a steady state.
In such cases they operate more like a pipe of fixed cross-section \cite<e.g.>{gimbert2016}.
Table~\ref{tab:Qs2} shows that in such a situation, the sediment transport scales much more severely with discharge, with the exponent on $Q$ being likely between $3$ and $5$, compared to other two regimes when that exponent is at most $1.3$ (Table~\ref{tab:Qs2}).
Thus fluctuations of discharge on short timescales (on the order of a day) have the potential to cause very high sediment transport conditions.
