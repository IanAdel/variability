\maketitle

\paragraph{Key findings:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sediment transport capacity in pressurized subglacial channels  responds differently to changing water discharge in open fluvial channels.
\item Sediment transport capacity varies far more in subglacial channels compared to fluvial ones, even though changing channel width  in fluvial channels accommodates some of the difference.
\item Differences in the sediment transport capacity response to changing water discharge could impact processes at proglacial margins and the interpretation of sediment transport records from glaciers. 
\end{enumerate}

\abstract % 150 words
Sediment transport capacity depends largely on the velocity of water flowing through a channel and the channel width over which to mobilize sediment.
In fluvial channels, changing water discharge can be accommodated by changing water depth and width, as well as water velocity.
In subglacial channels over short time scales, however, water flows through a conduit with fixed size and is pressurized by the ice above.
As a result, changing water discharge only may result in modifying water velocity.
Parameterizations of flow in pressurized, subglacial channels and  subaerial fluvial channels show that sediment transport capacity varies  more in response to changing water discharge in subglacial channels compared to fluvial ones.
This characteristic of sediment transport capacity in subglacial systems holds true  across a wide range of channel geometries and flow conditions.
The increased variability in sediment transport capacity impacts the interpretation of records of sediment transport from glacierized catchments compared to fluvial ones.

Sediment transport capacity responds differently to changing water discharge in subglacial and fluvial channels.
In both subglacial and fluvial channels, sediment transport capacity, to the first order, depends on 1) the channel width over-which to mobilize sediment and 2) the water's shear stress on sediment at the channel bottom to mobilize it.
The shear stress depends largely on water velocity.
In fluvial channels, changing water discharge will change the water depth, water velocity (controlling sediment transport capacity),  and channel width (which dictates the span over which sediment transport  will occur).
Conversely, in subglacial environments, on short times scales of hours to days, subglacial channels only experience a change in water velocity following changing water discharge, because the water flows through a subglacial conduit with a fixed geometry.
The fixed conduit geometry also means that the channel width, over-which sediment can be mobilized, does not respond to changing water discharge.
As a result, sediment transport capacity varies far more in subglacial channels compared to fluvial ones, even though changing channel width can accommodate some sediment transport variability in fluvial channels.
This increased variability has several important implications for sediment transport in glacial systems compared to fluvial ones.

  \section{Introduction}
   
  Glaciers are well known for the quantities of sediment that they expel from their termini \citep{hallet1996}.
  Changing glacier dynamics, geomorphology, and hydrology in cold regions has prompted a recent focus on subglacial sediment transport processes \citep[e.g.][]{zhang2022}.
  To date, numerical models consider sediment discharge from glaciers as a function of the availability of sediment, either from the erosion of bedrock or the existence of sediment and the transport capacity of this sediment by fluvial processes below the glacier \citep{creyts2013,brinkerhoff2017,beaud2018,delaney2019}.
  These models often represent sediment transport processes similar to rivers, with the main difference being that water flows through a subglacial conduit, pressurized by the ice above \citep{rothlisberger1972}.

  When an adequate quantity of sediment is present as to be transported fluvially (i.e. in a ``transport-limited'' regime), shear-stress between the water and the sediment that it flows over is a first-order control on the transport of sediment \citep{shields1936}.
  Shear stress increases with the water velocity and roughness of the channel.
  Greater shear stress will mobilize increased quantities of sediment, along with larger sizes of sediment clasts.
  The fundamental role of this shear-stress is demonstrated in sediment transport relationships such as \citet{shields1936}.
  Sediment transport equations such as \citet{meyer1948}  and \citet{engelund1967} use shear stress, or an approximation thereof, to evaluate sediment transport capacity per unit width.

  While sediment transport over a unit width of the channel depends directly on shear-stress \citep[e.g.][]{meyer1948}, the total sediment transport capacity across a channel's cross depends on the integrated shear-stress over the entire channel bed (Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}).
  Furthermore, as water discharge changes, the channel's cross-sectional area, as well as the water velocity, accommodates the variations.
  As a result, channel geometry plays a key role in sediment transport in both fluvial channels and subglacial ones \citep[e.g.][]{church2006,delaney2019}.
  
  However, in response to changing water discharge, the behavior of subglacial channels diverges from fluvial ones.
  % In fluvial channels, the channel width and height may evolve with changing flow conditions, but the underlying channel geometry responds on a far longer timescale than water discharge of the water discharge \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}\,b and d; e.g. ][]{church2006}.
  In subglacial channels, however, the water is pressurized in a subglacial channel and the size of this channel responds to the roughness of the channel walls and the velocity of the water flowing through the channel \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}\,a and c; e.g. ][]{rothlisberger1972}.
  Here, diurnal variations in water flux, for instance, may cause water to flow through a conduit whose size does not respond to the same timescales as the increase in water flux \citep{rothlisberger1972}.
  With respect to sediment transport, this means that increased water discharge in subglacial channels will result in greater water velocity and thus sediment transport capacity.
  At the same time, the fixed channel width in subglacial channels means that the channel width over which to mobilize sediment does not evolve over the same timescales as water discharge \citep[e.g.][]{werder2010}.
  
  Conversely, in fluvial systems with open-channel flow, a commensurate increase in water discharge will be accommodated by both a reduced increase in water velocity, along with increased channel width and/or depth (Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}\,b and d).
  The water velocity change might be lower, but the width over which sediment can be mobilized increases given by discharge to width scaling relationships \citep{yalin1992}.
  Thus, the systematic response in sediment transport capacity with respect to changing water discharge is fundamentally different in the two systems.

  % While these differences between open-channel and pressurized flow have been well documented \cite{}, their implications on sediment transport are less well explored \citep[e.g.][]{walder1994}.
  The different processes in subglacial and fluvial systems have been implicitly included in a wide range of available models and relationships that transport sediment in both glacial and fluvial environments \citep[e.g.][]{yalin1992,walder1994,beaud2018,wickert2019}.
  Furthermore, models of fluvial transport of sediment in glacial and fluvial systems have been used to understand the relationship between sediment dynamics and climate \citep[e.g.][]{tucker1997,delaney2020}
  Yet, the differing relationship between variations in water discharge and sediment discharge in subglacial and fluvial systems  has been less well discussed.

  To compare the differences in the response of sediment transport capacity to water discharge, this manuscript leverages parameterizations of subglacial hydraulics and fluvial hydraulics.
  Parameterizations are applied to explore the differences in the relationship between sediment transport capacity and water discharge and the impact of water discharge variability on sediment transport capacity in the two systems.
  Lastly, the implications for sediment transport processes in subglacial systems, compared to fluvial ones, are discussed.

  \section{Methodology}
  \label{sect:meth}
  This section contains the relationships between water discharge, subglacial water velocity, and channel geometry in both fluvial and subglacial channels.
  Both parameterizations are to represent shear stress, upon which sediment transport commonly depends \citep[][]{shields1936}, and integrate this value across the channel bed.
  Note that both parameterizations evaluate shear stress, as opposed to sediment transport capacity, as shear stress omits a grain size parameter and the choice of a sediment transport relationship \citep{shields1936}.

  \subsection{Subglacial channel  parameterization}
  \label{sect:sub_mode}
  To parameterize the shear stress of water flowing across sediments below a glacier, the subglacial channel parameterization evaluates the channel geometry and the velocity of the flowing water. 
  To accomplish this,  a version of hydraulics parameterization presented in \citet{delaney2019} is used.
  The parameterization uses the assumption that the water is transported through subglacial channels \citep[Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}; ][]{rothlisberger1972}, and that a channel and geometry will respond to a representative water discharge over a certain time period $Q_{w}^*$, using the Darcy-Weisbach formulation for water-flow through a pipe to describe this relationship \citep[e.g.][]{rothlisberger1972,clarke2003,werder2013}.
  Here, it is assumed that the hydraulic diameter of the subglacial channel, $D_h$, responds to a representative water discharge, $Q_{w}^*$, and a representative gradient of the hydraulic potential, $\Psi^*$:
  \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:DW}
      D_h = \big(s\, f_r\,\rho_w\, \frac{Q_w^{*\,2}}{\Psi^*}\big)^{\frac{1}{5}}~~.
    \end{equation}
  \end{linenomath*}
  % 
  The representative hydraulic gradient is based upon the pressurized flow in Equation~\ref{eq:DW},
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:psi}
    \Psi^*= f_f \,  \rho_i \, g (\nabla z_{sg} - \nabla z_c) +  \rho_i \, g \, \nabla z_c,
  \end{equation}
  % 
  \noindent
  where, $f_f$ is the flotation fraction, $\rho_i$ is density of ice $\nabla z_{sg}$ is the surface slope of the glacier and $\nabla z_{c}$ is the glacier bed slope.
  
  In Equation~\ref{eq:DW}, $f_r$ is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor and $\rho_w$ is the density of water (Table \ref{table:vpm}). $s$ is a factor accounting for channel geometry \citep{hooke1990}, calculated as:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Hf}
    s = \frac{2\,(\beta -\sin \beta)^2}{(\frac{\beta}{2}\,+\,\sin \frac{\beta}{2})^4},
  \end{equation}
  where $\beta$ is the central angle of the circular segment that comprises the channel (the so-called Hooke angle).
  Smaller values of $\beta$ result in shallow, wide channels, and $\beta =\pi$ corresponds to a semi-circle.
  The width of the flat channel floor $w_c$ is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dh2wc}
    w_{cg} = 2  \sin \frac{\beta}{2} \sqrt{\frac{2\, S}{\beta -\sin \beta}},
  \end{equation}
  % 
  where $S$ is the cross-sectional area of the channel given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dh2S}
    S_g =  \frac{D_h^2}{2}~ \frac{\Big(\frac{\beta}{2} \,+ \, \sin \frac{\beta}{2}\Big)^2  }{\beta\,-\,\sin \beta}.
  \end{equation}
  
  The shear stress, $\tau$, between the water and the channel bed is determined through the Darcy-Weisbach formulation
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tau}
    \tau_g=\frac{1}{8}\,f_r\,\rho_w\,v_g^2,
  \end{equation}
  % 
  where $v_g = \frac{Q_w}{S_g}$ is the water velocity.
  Here, $Q_w$ represents the instantaneous water discharge, not used to evaluate the hydraulic gradient of the channel in Equation~\ref{eq:DW}.
  The channel size is usually not in equilibrium with the quantity of water flowing through it.
  With this formulation, the processes in an R-channel can be represented algebraically \citep{delaney2019}.

  For purposes discussed below, we evaluate the width integrated shear stress as $\tau_{tg}=w_{cg}\,\tau_g $.

  \subsection{Fluvial channel  parameterization}
  \label{sect:fluv}
  
  The fluvial channel parameterization implements the hydraulics parameterization presented in \citet{tucker1997}.
  Here, the assuming the conservation of mass, sufficiently wide channels so that the hydraulic radius is consistent with flow depth, uniform flow, and the Darcy-Weisbach relationship,
  the shear stress $\tau_f$ at the river bed is represented as
  \begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:DW_tau}
      \tau_f=\frac{\rho_w\,g^{\frac{2}{3}}\,f_p^{\frac{1}{3}}}{2}\, \Big(\frac{Q_w}{w_{cf}} \Big)^{\frac{2}{3}} \,\nabla z_{c}^{\frac{2}{3}},
    \end{equation}
  \end{linenomath*}
  where $\nabla z_{c}$ is the channel slope, and $f_p$ is the friction factor for fluvial systems.
  Channel width $w_{cf}$ is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:wcf}
    w_{cf} = k \, Q_w^e,
  \end{equation}
  % 
  where $k$ is a constant and $e$ is an exponent commonly equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ \citep{leopold1953}. Cross-sectional area is 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Sf}
    S_f= \frac{Q_w}{v_f}.
  \end{equation}
  As in Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}, the width integrated shear stress is $\tau_{tf}=w_{cf}\,\tau_f$.
  Hydraulic diameter of the channel is given by $D_{hf} = \frac{4\,w_{cf}\,d}{2\,d+w_{cf}}$, with flow depth $d$ determined from knowledge of $S_f$ and $w_{cf}$ in a rectangular channel.
  
  \subsection{Implementation}

  The formulation for the glacial system above requires inputs of the hydraulic gradient, water discharge, representative water discharge, Hooke angle $\beta$ \citep{hooke1990}, and friction factor $f_r$ to evaluate channel shape.
  Values of $\beta$ and $f_r$ are chosen so that they produce reasonable values of water velocity, in accordance with available measurements through dye-tracing \citep[Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}, Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}; e.g.][]{werder2010}.
  
  In the fluvial system, the water is not pressurized, so only the bed slope is needed. Friction factor $f_f$ and channel shape factor $k$ are assigned (Section~\ref{sect:fluv}).

  The Reynolds number $R_e$ is given as 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:re}
    R_e\,=\, v \,\frac{D_h}{\nu},
  \end{equation}
  % 
  \noindent where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of water, and  $v$ is velocity of water, $v_g$ or $v_f$.

  The variance $ \chi$ of a variable $\Gamma$ is given by 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:var}
    \chi(\Gamma) \,=\, 1 - \frac{\mathrm{min}(\Gamma)}{\mathrm{max}(\Gamma)}\,\,.
  \end{equation}
  % 
  \noindent Below we examine variables, $\Gamma$, water discharge ($Q_w$) water velocity ($v$, $v_f$), shear stress ($\tau$, $\tau_f$), and integrated shear stress ($\tau_t$, $\tau_{tf}$).

  
  \section{Results}
  First, the subglacial hydraulics parameterization is applied to a representative water discharge (Equation~\ref{eq:DW}) of $12$\,\unit{m}$^{3}$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$.
  Both setups are then forced with a water discharge of between $8$ and $16$ \,\unit{m}$^{3}$\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$, to represent diurnal variations in water discharge.
  
  \begin{center}
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{model_outputs.pdf}
      \caption{Response of channel width (a), hydraulic diameter (b),  Reynolds number  (c),  water velocity (d), shear-stress (e), and width-integrated shear-stress (f)  to different water discharge values.

Gray space represents water discharge below the mean value. }
      \label{fig:model_outs}
    \end{figure}
  \end{center}
  
  Across the hydrological forcing, variable water discharge results in a substantial increase in the range of water velocities in the glacial system compared to the fluvial system (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}).
  While water velocity in the glacier system varies by  $0.5$ (Equation~\ref{eq:var}) over the discharge values, in the fluvial system the water velocity only varies by $0.08$.
  Similarly, shear stress at the bed varies by $0.75$ across the range of water discharge values, whereas shear stress across the fluvial system varies by roughly $0.17$\,\%. This increased variability  in shear stress between the two systems occurs as the water velocity is raised to the power of $2$ in Equation~\ref{eq:tau}. 
  These differences in both shear stress and water velocity demonstrate key differences in the sediment transport capacity in the glacier and fluvial systems.
  Changing channel geometry accommodates evolving water discharge in the fluvial system (Equation~\ref{eq:wcf}), whereas in the subglacial case, increased water flux can only be accommodated by an increase in velocity (Equation~\ref{eq:DW}).
  
  However, the variable channel width in the fluvial case results in an evolving surface over which to transport sediment in response to changing water discharge (Equation~\ref{eq:wcf}).
  The range of values between width-integrated shear stress in the fluvial system increases to $0.44$\,\%, whereas, in the glacial system, remains at $0.75$\,\%, compared to the shear stress.
  Indeed, the relative  difference in width-integrated shear stress is less between the fluvial and glacier cases, compared to the water velocity and shear stress outputs.
  The reduced variability in width-integrated shear stress results from the additional width across the fluvial channel that accommodates a portion of the sediment transport capacity.

  Next, the setup is run $25,000$ times with randomly selected channel geometries ($k=(2,6)$, $\beta=(\frac{\pi}{10},\pi)$), friction factors ($f_i=(0.001,20)$, $f_p=(0.001,20)$) and water discharges (maximum and minimum values selected between $5$ to $500$ \,\mmma). $Q_w^*$ in Equation ~\ref{eq:DW} is determined as the midpoint in the water discharge range. Parameter combinations are only selected if their maximum and minimum velocities are between $0.2$ and $3$\,\unit{m}\,\unit{s}$^{-1}$, resulting in roughly $10,600$ adequate parameter combinations.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{multi_run.pdf}
      \caption{Ratio of range of a variable $\Gamma$ for glacial and fluvial systems for water velocity  (a), shear-stress (b), and  width-integrated shear-stress (c) in response to mean water discharge,
        Range  $\chi$ for each variable is given in Equation~\ref{eq:var}. Values greater (less) than $1$ shown in white (gray) are parameter combinations that vary more in a subglacial (fluvial) system. Plots (d-f) show the response of variable $\Gamma$ to the variability in water discharge ($\chi(Q_w)$) in the parameter combination. 
        Histograms (g-i) show the frequency of variations across variables in the parameterization.}
      \label{fig:range}
    \end{figure}
  \end{center}

  Across the accepted model runs, variability in water velocity and shear stress remains substantially higher across the subglacial model compared to fluvial ones (Figure~\ref{fig:range}).
  Water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress all have a variability ratio ($\frac{\chi(\Gamma_{g})}{\chi(\Gamma_f)}$) greater than $1$ in the subglacial  system compared to fluvial one (Figure~S1).
  
  The minimum ratio of  water velocity, $\frac{\chi(v_{g})}{\chi(v_{f})}$, and shear-stress, $\frac{\chi(\tau_{g})}{\chi(\tau_{f})}$, is around $2$, showing that these factors are substantially more variable in subglacial channels compared to fluvial ones.
  The width integrated shear stress, $\frac{\chi(\tau_{tg})}{\chi( \tau_{tf})}$, spans between $1.02$ and $2.4$, showing  accommodation of the reduced shear stress by increasing the channel width in the fluvial system.
  However, no runs experienced width integrated shear stress, $\frac{\chi(\tau_{tg})}{\chi( \tau_{tf})}$, less than $1$.
  
  Runs with the smallest variability in discharge ($\chi(Q_w)$) have the greatest variability in water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress in subglacial systems compared to fluvial ones (Figure~\ref{fig:range} and S1).
  Yet, the greatest difference in the two systems at the smallest variations of water discharge still results in greater variability in the subglacial system compared to the fluvial one (Figure S1).

  \section{Discussion}
  \subsection{Assumptions}

  The direct comparison between the systems remains difficult as they exist with different hydraulic potentials, and the response of channel width to water discharge varies considerably based on the values chosen for $\beta$ and $k$.
  
  The subglacial parameterization assumes that the friction factor does not evolve between the formation of the channel and the sediment transport conditions examined.
  The role of this effect is uncertain, and most numerical models assume a steady friction factor \citep[e.g.][]{werder2013}. 
  However, the friction factor has been documented to evolve in time \citep{pohle2022}.
  Furthermore, both subglacial and fluvial parameterizations here assume that the distribution of velocity and shear stress of water across the channel bed is homogeneous (Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}~and~\ref{sect:fluv}). 

  The subglacial parameterization also assumes that subglacial water is pressurized, which is a commonly held assumption in subglacial hydrology \citep[e.g.][]{gimbert2016}.
  While the subglacial channel geometry need not be in a steady state for the water to remain pressurized, the subglacial parameterization assumes that the channel geometry must vary minimally over the timescales of varying  water discharge \citep[e.g.][]{nanni2020}.
  Note that in R-channel formulations with changing melt input, the variability in sediment transport capacity could be somewhat smaller than the parameterizations here.
  Here, peaks in the hydrograph would occur as the R-channel is opening due to pressure melt, thus causing a decrease in velocity compared to the results here \citep{rothlisberger1972}.
  A similar effect could occur with creep closure of the subglacial channel at the hydrograph minima.
  
  The fluvial channel parameterization (Section~\ref{sect:fluv}) assumes that sediment transported across all channel widths, as opposed bankfull width when most sediment transport occurs \citep{wolman1960}.
  As a result, the variability in the fluvial system across the range of discharge values could be underestimated in the parameterization (Figure~\ref{fig:range}).


  
  \subsection{Geomorphic Implications}
  \label{sect:GI}
  The consistent relationship between water discharge variability and relative variability of the water velocity, shear stress, and width-integrated shear stress results from the fixed geometry in the glacier system and variable geometry in the fluvial system as they respond to changes in water discharge (Equations~\ref{eq:tau} and \ref{eq:Sf}).
  Increased variability in sediment transport capacity with respect to discharge has several implications for sediment transport in subglacial systems compared to fluvial ones.
  Shear stress is scaled to the $\frac{3}{2}$ power  and relies on shear stress exceeding a threshold in sediment transport relationships  such as \citet{meyer1948}.
  In the total sediment transport relationship \citet{engelund1967}, the shear stress is scaled to $\frac{5}{2}$ power.
  In both cases, the exponent greater than $1$ magnifies the variability in sediment transport beyond the highly variable shear stress and width-integrated shear stress described above in subglacial environments (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}\, b and d; Figure~S1).

  
  \subsubsection{Sediment transport subglacially and at glacier margins}

  The response of sediment discharge caused by the greater variability in sediment transport in subglacial channels will be greatest in completely transport-limited regimes \citep{kasmalkar2019}.
  In supply-limited systems, the changing sediment transport capacity (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}) would have a minimal effect on sediment discharge due to the absence of sediment available for transport \citep{delaney2019}.
  Yet, reaching the threshold of motion for sediment more frequently may result in additional sediment transport and the tendency for glaciers to transport sediment in a supply-limited case \citep[e.g.][]{herman2015}.

  The effect of pressurized channel flow could be most pronounced during precipitation or flood events when subglacial conduits have not adapted to the water discharge flowing through them, resulting in a very large increase in sediment transport capacity \citep{delaney2019}.
  Precipitation events have been documented to result in exceptionally high sediment discharge from glaciers \citep{cowan1988,delaney2018}.
  Increased sediment discharge may result from changes to sediment access below the glacier, yet rapid increases in water velocity from water flowing through a small conduit, not conditioned by the amount of water flow, will cause a large increase in sediment transport capacity (Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}).
  
  Increased variability in sediment transport also impacts sediment export from glacier margins into proglacial areas \citep[e.g.][]{lane2016,delaney2017,perolo2018}.
  Here, in the transition to open-channel flow as the water leaves the glacier, velocities at the highest water discharges could generally decrease (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}, blue and green horizontal bars), potentially resulting in sediment deposition once sediment enters the proglacial area.
 Note that the transition from pressurized to open channel flow could occur above the glacier's terminus, when cavity closure rates are reduced and water can flow freely \citep{egli2021b}, resulting in intermittent deposition and remobilization of sediment below the glacier terminus \citep{perolo2018}.
  
  In large catchments and further downstream of proglacial margins, water discharge is generally far less variable than at the tops of catchments, where glaciers lie \citep[c.f.][]{costa2017,vanas2017,delaney2018,hasholt2018}.
  Here, external hydrological factors further downstream of glaciers could result in smaller variations in sediment transport capacity in many fluvial systems compared to subglacial ones.
  The parameterization here shows that the smallest variability in water discharge has the largest difference in relative variability from subglacial to proglacial systems (Figure~\ref{fig:model_outs}\, d,\,e,\,f), while the variability in the subglacial system remains higher (Figure~S1).
  Therefore, at locations such as the Greenland Ice Sheet, with smaller diurnal variations in water discharge compared to smaller catchments in the Alps \citep[c.f.][]{delaney2018,hasholt2018}, the variability in sediment transport capacity in the transition from the ice sheet to the proglacial river could be more dramatic than alpine systems as water leaves the glacier and moves downstream.

  
  \subsubsection{Records of sediment discharge  from glaciers}

  Large variations in sediment transport capacity below glaciers may result in sediment mobilization and deposition processes in close spatial and temporal proximity to each other below the glacier \citep{gimbert2016,perolo2018}, in response to both evolving channel geometry and water discharge with accumulating with melt down-glacier \citep{beaud2018,delaney2019}.
  Increasing variability in sediment transport down-glacier is likely because of spatial discontinuities in sediment availability, increasing water discharge down the glacier, and the transport times of subglacial sediment \citep{williams1989,delaney2019}.
  The rapid increase and decreases in sediment transport capacity over a diurnal cycle in a subglacial system, for instance, compounds the variability already present in fluvial systems \citep{williams1989,jerolmack2010}.
  As a result, variations in sediment transport capacity could be responsible for the fluctuations in sediment discharge (``flushings'') from glaciers that are not attributed to variations in water discharge \citep[e.g.][]{richards2003,swift2021}, but could be the result of reduced conduit size and therefore increased sediment transport capacity.
  
   Records of sediment discharge have been used to establish the relationship, or lack thereof, between sediment discharge and climate in glacial systems \citep[e.g.][]{koppes2009a,willenbring2016,mariotti2021}.
  The variability in subglacial sediment transport capacity presented here applies most generally to short-time scales responsible for the size of subglacial channels.
  Yet, variability in sediment transport from glaciers may add to the already large amount of noise in the fluvial transport of sediment from the glacier to the sink  \citep{castletort2003,jerolmack2010,romans2016}, should the glacier be land-terminating with a proglacial river connecting the glacier to the sink of sediment.
   Therefore, identifying climatic signals in sediment transport from transport-limited glaciers may require higher thresholds of climatic perturbation compared to fluvial systems \citep{tofelde2021}, given the amount of noise present.
  For instance, sediment discharge records from two glaciers in the Swiss Alps show that $40$ to $50$\% of a season's sediment discharge occurs when water discharge is below the $75^{\mathrm{th}}$ quantile of the season \citep{delaney2018}, possibly because sediment transport capacity relies on the size of the glacier conduit, in addition to water discharge (Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}).
  This suggests that a larger perturbation in water discharge might be needed to significantly alter the sediment discharge from the glacier compared to a fluvial system, should the subglacial sediment transport be in a largely transport-limited regime.
 
  Additional processes and erosional hiatuses may further complicate signals of sediment discharge from glaciers in response to climate, compared to fluvial systems \citep{jansson2005,ganti2016}. 
  If a glacier expels sediment in a transport-limited regime, the pressurized nature of subglacial water flow means sediment discharge capacity responds to the thickness of the ice, controlling the closure of the channel, and the surface slope of the glacier \citep{rothlisberger1972,shreve1972}, controlling water velocity, in addition to water discharge (Section~\ref{sect:sub_mode}).
  Conversely, sediment transport in most fluvial systems increases with water discharge and bed slope \citep[Section~\ref{sect:fluv}; e.g.][]{muller1968,whipple1999,wong2006}. 
  Furthermore, if the glacier is in the supply-limited case, sediment discharge record will also represents additional processes of sliding  \citep{herman2015,seguinot2021}, adding additional processes represented in the sediment discharge signal \citep{delaney2019}.

  
  \section{Conclusions}
  
  Divergent processes occur in sediment transport capacity's response to water discharge that exists between subglacial and fluvial systems due to their fixed and variable channel geometry, respectively.
  Parameterization of these processes shows that variability in water velocity and shear stress in response to variable water discharge is much higher in subglacial channels than in fluvial ones.
  The variability in shear stress is reduced when the evolving channel width is accounted for in fluvial systems, yet, the variability in width-integrated shear stress is still higher in subglacial systems.
  When shear stress and width integrated shear stress are linked to sediment transport capacity \citep[e.g.][]{shields1936,meyer1948,engelund1967}, sediment transport capacity can vary far more in subglacial systems compared to fluvial ones.

  A subglacial channel's greater variability in sediment transport capacity is a process that limits geomorphic comparison with fluvial systems, given impacts on the mobilization, transport, and deposition of sediment below glaciers.
  This variability in sediment transport capacity could cause sediment deposition for sediment transport in glacier margins, where water flow transitions from pressurized subglacial flow to open-channel and fluvial.
  Sediment transport in glacier systems responds to a large number of factors such as ice thickness and glacier surface slope, which may respond to climate differently than water discharge. 
  The inconsistent response of subglacial and fluvial systems to water discharge could adds additional noise to sediment transport signals in glacial systems compared to fluvial ones.

  As a result, the parameterization here is most relevant for relatively wide rivers, where channel width evolves greatly with water discharge (Equation~\ref{eq:wcf}).
  % This is probably the case in many proglacial rivers and glacierized catchments where the divergent behavior of subglacial and fluvial channels is most relevant (Figure~\ref{sect:GI}) \ian{Find reference about the geometry of proglacial river}.
